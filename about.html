    <p>In my legitimate activities, I am a quiet programmer for the "respectable software company" Meta Cortex. But I am is also computer hacker who penetrates computer systems illicitly and steals information under my awesome hacker alias "Neo". 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        And I also sell illegal untraceable computer systems and hacking programs along with controlling computer viruses stashed on CDs and diskettes. During my time as a hacker, I have learned about something known only as "The Matrix". It is described as a vague notion that I have felt my whole life that "there is something wrong with the world"
